# About

[Maintenance discontinued] The repository contains a rudimentary webpage template I created when I learn about web development the first time (maybe one or two years ago).

If you create the asset folder and the video folder and place a video and soundtrack in the corresponding folders, the "webpage" should loop the soundtrack with the video being the website's background.

Of course, what I made is considered trash using today's standard, but you may find this useful in some weird contexts (perhaps as a bad example when teaching?). I keep this repository only because of its historic value.
